    <center><h2>I just made the worlds largest ice chair (5/12/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>

had a dream where mr beast was trying to construct the largest ice chair possible in sweden to try and get a guiness world record for karl, it was designed specifically in mind for him to sit in, and they left it out on the water floating over night for some reason, and then when they woke up the next morning, it turns out a lot of small creatures tried eating the inside of the ice chair somehow, including pincher bugs, cockroaches, and a giant fish. <br><br>
They then decide since the integrity of the chair is at stake, they just give up??? <br><br>
they decide to go surfboarding in the swedish winter and the video ends there. <br><br>
I go up to my mom and ask her about what places shes gone to, and that includes somewhere not far from where mr beast shot the video, and I spent some time recapping the video for her
