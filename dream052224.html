    <center><h2>suitcase star wars (5/22/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        another constant with my dreams is half the time my parents just are not driving the car and like my brother is or something<br><br>
        we get out of this rv rental place where we load up all the stuff for our trip to somewhere, with my brother driving the car (hes 14) because my moms too tired or something, then play a commercial for some disney xd show looking thing where someone hops in a magical briefcase and gets transported to this old house to go look around. <br><br>
        Outside of that briefcase is a different old house, being prepped for a party of sorts. <br><br>
        Im given a lightsaber with a giant battery for some reason, as I go ahead and hang up a bunch of party decorations for some reason, including my goofy goober drawing poster, then my dad starts to complain about my decorating skills as hes eating nachos with a bunch of other people, meanwhile in the suitcase realm piggy from the muppets also gets a battery lightsaber, and the magical suitcase from earlier and her have a lightsaber duel, until someone else pops up (I forget who) and demonstrates that the batteries are the only power here and theyll run out soon so just stop fighting anyway, which we do and other stuff happened but I waited too long to recount the dream

    </h3>
