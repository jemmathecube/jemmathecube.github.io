    <center><h2>fred video essay (4/29/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        so I had a dream about fred from scooby-doo becoming a video essay youtuber and talking about what cartoon network/nickelodeon shows became the most bloated, one of them had an episode where some kids saw an ad on tv for obama island, and had a singing mermaid thing on a stage, and the kids begged the parent to go with them, and he said yes, only for them to arrive at obama island with a toy head of the mermaid singing prerecorded messages on top of this small shark table.<br><br>
        The small shark table also sings about how many fingers he's eaten and then chases the dad all across the room.<br><br>Fred from Scooby-Doo comments on this by saying that this is pretty funny but the plot points don't make any sense (how self-aware of you Fred), and explains that shows and ongoing narratives have to follow a specific plot structure, where as often as there's important episodes to explain the ongoing plot, there's as many that ease the tension a bit.<br><br>
        Then he comments on his OWN show, and chastises Daphne for not reacting to anything (calling her Velma for some reason), and essentially complaining that she's too much of a girlboss and doesn't react scared to anything.<br><br>
        And then, fucking out of nowhere, Fred from Scooby-Doo, in his omnipotent video essay, talking about CARTOON characters, says that he PREFERRED Kim Jong Un as a character because he wasn't as much of a girlboss and was scared of stuff then I woke up an hour before I was supposed to and was stuck in a limbo of falling asleep and not falling asleep until actually being up when I was meant to<br><br>
