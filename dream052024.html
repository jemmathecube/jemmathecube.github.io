    <center><h2>the world is going to end (5/20/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>




had a dream where the entire world learned of this meteor that was going to destroy the world, so one particular group of people go through multiple dimensions to figure out how to stop the meteor, even going into the third dimension from the phineas and ferb movie, a lot of time is spent figuring out ways to shoot it off course, and make sure it doesnt hit earth too bad. <br><br>
With every avenue tried, all hope seems lost. <br><br> Half the team leaves to be with their families, while the rest pray that something be done. <br><br>
Eventually, this one viking guy you can see just randomly shooting arrows into the sky, and he eventually hits the meteor and slows it down, and as it turns out this really big meteor was the size of a basketball and hit the water (also with less momentum because viking guy), and everyone celebrated because yayyyy not dead or something
