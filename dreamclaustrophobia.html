    <center><h2>claustrophobia (???)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        This room looks exactly like my room, in the [doxxed place] house.<br><br>
        The floor slowly shifts and changes angles, and I slip slowly onto the wall, the door at an angle above me.<br><br>
        The floor and ceiling slowly close in on me, almost falling on top of me, without actually moving.<br><br>
        I try to climb the floor, but to no avail, as I keep screaming for help, with no answer.<br><br>
        I eventually wake up and my dad is sitting on my brother's bed, and it takes 20 minutes to snap out of my anxiety attack to realize it was no longer a dream.<br><br>



    </h3>
