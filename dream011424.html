    <center><h2>silverhair (1/14/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        at a boarding school as a younger kid and having a plan to turn someone's hair to silver using the sun instead of the usual gold so they lose the ice skating dance. <br> <br>
        We're in this huge amphitheater, with a packed ice rink with identical looking golden hair dancers, which all turn out to be fragments of the popular girl and her golden hair (probably the girl from jimmy neutron). <br><br>
        They all bump into each other as they all merge into one eldritch beast, who still wins the ice dancing competition out of pure fear. <br><br>
        Then, the other young kid person (probably jimmy neutron himself) pulls the huge fucking curtain and makes her hair turn to silver as she turns back into also a younger kid and then she doesn't win.<br><br>
        I (or whoever I'm spectating) says to themselves “I'm getting expelled and that's okay” or something like that. <br><br>
        Then, to apologize to her, we hire inspector gadget (he does say go go gadget at least four times before introducing himself) to invent multi-dimensional travel.
