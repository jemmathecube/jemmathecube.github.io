    <center><h2>will ferrell is god (2/29/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        My dad is trying to get to [doxxed place] from [doxxed place], taking 7 hours to get to [other doxxed place], bribing us with burgers to come along, then shortselling us by saying he was lying.<br><br>
        My parents then route us under a river to get to our destination, we drop in, then we all drown. <br><br>
        Miraculously, we're now at a house.<br><br>
        Under the house, is a large emerald crystal cave, but I decide not to take any emeralds, in case the house sinks into the ground.<br><br>
        We then find the time stream, and use it to travel to the past, the past being when we drowned in a river, but this time we ate burger patties as we drowned.<br><br>
        I then appear at a different house, on the side of a dirt road, where my dog keeps trying to get ran over by cars driving by.<br><br>
        I then try to stick my face in a vent on the ground, trying to enter spectator mode, but it doesn't work.<br><br>
        I then wake up in the FNAF 4 room, trying to fend off the animatronics, and while this is happening, I fall asleep, and get transported to a dream where I’m on top of a golden skyscraper, facing God and asking him why he must torment me with these dreams.<br><br>
        For some reason, I'm Will Ferrell.<br><br>
        For some reason, God is also Will Ferrell.<br><br>
        I try to pick up a knife, then awkwardly hold up a hairbrush, while depressingly trying to threaten god.<br><br>
        I then wake up to FNAF 4, and the animatronics no longer appear.<br><br>
        I think this is bullshit.<br><br>
        I fall back asleep to threaten god again, to no avail.<br><br>
        I wake up to FNAF 4.<br><br>
        I then actually wake up.<br><br>
